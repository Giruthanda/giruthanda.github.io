              The project PocketBuddy is primarily focused to be an aiding toolkit for adolescents approaching the undertakings of adulthood, and for parents or the elderly who would be needing the most assistance, given their age, for certain financial undertakings and errands that require their awareness and knowledge of values and numbers. The researchers aim to provide a webpage that would showcase what the application would entail, basically serving as a model reference for the ideal application due to the researchersâ€™ limited knowledge, resources, and time for an actual procurement of a feasible application.
